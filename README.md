# Diabetes Prediction using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of diabetes-related health metrics and predicts diabetes outcomes using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm. It leverages a dataset containing information on various health indicators to enhance the understanding and prediction of diabetes diagnoses.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to analyze a diabetes-related dataset and develop a predictive model using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The project emphasizes the importance of various health indicators such as glucose levels, insulin levels, and BMI in predicting diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database sourced from Kaggle. It includes the following health metrics:

- Number of Pregnancies
- Glucose Levels
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin Levels
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Age
- Diabetes Pedigree Function

## Installation

To run this project, you need the following packages:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-knn.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and run the script:

```
cd diabetes-prediction-knn
python diabetes_knn.py
```

## Methodology

The project utilizes the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, which classifies data points based on their proximity to other data points. The workflow includes:

1. Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for analysis.
2. Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features such as glucose and insulin levels.
3. Model Implementation: Developing the kNN classifier from scratch without using ML libraries.
4. Prediction: Evaluating the model's prediction accuracy on diabetes outcomes.

## Results

The model effectively demonstrates the relationship between certain health metrics and diabetes diagnosis, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing diabetes.
